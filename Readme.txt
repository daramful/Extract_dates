Name of the Program: Date Extraction
Author: Ginny Lee
Description: recognizes simple date expressions like: “January 15, 2014", "the 21st of December", "01/15/2014" (only the American notation), "Monday", "Monday the 23rd", “Christmas", "Labor Day". This program will extract the longest expression of dates written. So if the date is "Feb. 15th, 2018", it will generate as it is. 
Language (version): Python 3.6.3 with GCC 4.2.1. Compatible Clang 4.0.1
