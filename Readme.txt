Name of the Program: Date Extraction
Author: Ginny Lee
Language (version): Python 3.6.3 with GCC 4.2.1. Compatible Clang 4.0.1

** This problem is  derived from one of the problems from Speech and Language Processing authored by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin, international version, second edition: "Design an FSA that recognizes simple date expressions like March 15, the 22nd of November, Christmas. You should try to include all such "absolute" dates (e.g., not "deictic" ones relative to the current day, like the day before yesterday)."

Steps to take: 
1) To avoid a hassle of installing packages, I would like you to go on to any browser (Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
2) Please visit https://try.jupyter.org. 
	* This will redirect you to Jupyter Notebook right away.
	**It may lag and say you may have to wait a minute or so, but please don't refresh and stay on the page.
3) Once you get an access, please go to "Work" folder. It should be an empty folder.
4) On the top right corner, there should be a button called "Upload". Please press it, and upload every file in my submission: "Date_Extraction". Once you upload it, there should be a blue button named "Upload" on the right column of each file's name. Please click them all to process.
5) Once all are uploaded, please click date_extraction.ipynb. 
6) Click on the box that has my code on it. 
7) To print the list of dates, please press the following keys together: "Shift" key + "Enter/return" key
